# AegisAI – AI-Powered Scam Detection System

AegisAI is an AI-powered scam detection application developed as part of **Hackathon 2025**.  
The system analyzes user-provided messages or inputs to identify potential scams and suspicious patterns using machine learning and rule-based techniques.

The goal of AegisAI is to help users recognize fraudulent messages, phishing attempts, and scam content early, improving digital safety and awareness.


## Features

- **Scam Detection**: Analyzes text inputs to detect scam-like patterns  
- **AI-Based Analysis**: Uses NLP techniques to assess risk and intent  
- **Risk Classification**: Flags messages as safe or potentially fraudulent  
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common scam indicators such as urgency, threats, and suspicious links  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interaction  


## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Machine Learning / NLP**: Scikit-learn, NLP techniques  
- **Backend**: Python-based logic  
- **Frontend / Interface**: CLI / Web / Notebook (depending on implementation)  
- **Development Environment**: VS Code  


## How It Works

1. User inputs a message or text  
2. Text is preprocessed using NLP techniques  
3. Features are extracted and analyzed  
4. The model evaluates scam likelihood  
5. Output indicates whether the message is **Safe** or **Potential Scam**


## Use Cases

- Detect phishing messages  
- Identify scam emails or SMS  
- Raise awareness about digital fraud  
- Educational tool for understanding scam patterns  


## Hackathon Context

This project was developed during **Hackathon 2025**, focusing on applying AI to solve real-world cybersecurity and fraud-prevention problems.


## Future Improvements

- Real-time URL analysis  
- Browser or email integration  
- Improved model accuracy with larger datasets  
- Multi-language support  
- Web-based UI deployment
